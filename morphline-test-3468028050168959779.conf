		     # excodeblockssions to extract values from an Avro object. Each excodeblockssion 
		     # consists of a record output field name, which appears to the left of the 
		     # colon ':' and zero or more path steps, which appear to the right. 
		     # Each path step is separated by a '/' slash. Avro arrays are 
		     # traversed with the '[]' notation.

		     # The result of a path excodeblockssion is a list of objects, each of which 
		     # is added to the given record output field.

		     # structures, records, arrays, maps, unions, and others, as well as a flatten 
		     # option that collects the primitives in a subtree into a flat list. In the 
		     # paths specification, entries on the left of the colon are the target Solr 
		     # field and entries on the right specify the Avro source paths. Paths are read 
		     # from the source that is named to the right of the colon and written to the
